## Short description

This is an example of a production-ready clean architecture project setup.
It also shows a very simple OO model (rich domain model).
Below is a diagram showing the architecture that was defined by Robert C. Martin, and has been implemented in this
application.
The same terms as Robert C. Martin has used, have been used in categorizing the adapters.
Note that the MVC pattern seen in the diagram below can also be observed in the clean-architecture-app.
